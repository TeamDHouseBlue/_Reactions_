    <h1>Reactions</h1>
    <p>We are here to discuss about the reactions of the people hearing about the Covid-19 virus. <br><br>
    Many think that it is a mere and fake government excuse to attract attention towards themselves. What these people
dont't realise is that the cases and deaths shown on various websites isn't just a random number but the number people who 
were affected by the disease and even died. Everyone should understand that it is a very dangerous virus as it has affected
millions of people. Unless we come together and take the precautions that are necessary to stop this virus, it will not end.
<br><br>

  There are many other people too who think that this virus is dangerous but they still go out, party and many go for 
  vacations too. What they don't understand is that through them, how many people are at risk. It may happen that the virus
  has not affected them but through them has reached out to many people and caused many to die too.
  <br><br>
  As this virus can cause its effect through air, water and contact, we all must come together and take all the 
  precautions possible so that we can prove that even though we all have our differences, we can keep them aside and
  fight away anything that will challenge us.
